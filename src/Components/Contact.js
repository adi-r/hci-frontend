Interviews

We took a semi-structured for our interview with the goal being to discover how receptive the audience would be when it comes to donating/sharing food people. We asked our interviewees a few questions to establish their demographics and details regarding their food wastage:
- Who do you live with?
- How much food would you say that your household usually throws away each week?
- What are the main reasons that food gets wasted in your household?
- What motivates you to avoid food waste?
- How often do you donate food? Are there any particular food items that you ve donated/received more than others?
- Are you ok with eating leftovers? If not, what might boost your confidence in eating them?
- How far would you go/travel to pick up free food?
- Have you ever volunteered with a shelter or organization?
- Could you name a few shelters/NGOs in Chicago?


We continued the conversations to get an idea of how aware people are about food wastage and other questions leaning towards user privacy and how ok they would be with sharing their location with unknown people while donating food.

Surveys

The goal of our survey was to gain an understanding of the most frequently performed actions when it comes to food wastage. We create a Google form with 10 questions which we shared with our classmates, friends, and family. FORM PHOTO
