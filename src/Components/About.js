LITERATURE REVIEW AND MARKET ANALYSIS
● 16 apps helping companies and consumers prevent food waste - Katerina
Bozhinova
○ Multiple applications are leveraging the concept of sharing food to reduce
wastage. However, most of these applications are focused on the B2B aspect
and a limited number of applications focus on general consumers
○ Most applications suffer due to logistics, more specifically the lack of
transportation.

USER SCENARIOS
● Scenario 1: John Doe is a 32-year-old working male. John placed an order for delivery
of items before realizing he’s bought an extra pack of salt and a few vegetables that he
already has a stock of. Instead of throwing away food, John decides to donate the
excess food via the application. He shares information about the food such as the expiry
date, the date on which the product/item was bought, the quantity of the product, and the
location from which the item can be picked up. John then receives a notification stating
someone has chosen to pick up the item. John can then get in contact with the receiver
and exchange more information as needed. John can designate a spot from where the
receiver picks up the item or he can choose to personally give it to them
● Scenario 2: Jane Doe is a 44-year-old woman struggling with homelessness. She
requires a quick meal when she gets a notification from the application stating that
there’s a food item currently being donated. She chooses to accept the donation and
receives details regarding the pickup location of the item and the time till it’s available.
She goes to the pickup location, picks up the food item, and updates the status of the
item on her phone
