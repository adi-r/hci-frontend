That\u2019s estimated to be 30-40 percent of the entire US food supply and equates to 219 pounds of waste per person. Our project aims to solve this issue at the grassroots level by allowing users in a community to share any unnecessary food with other members of the community. This not only cuts down on food waste but also creates public awareness about the matter. We propose our solution: FORAGER, an interface that allows users to not only donate unnecessary food but also receives food items as and when needed. Currently built on Android, our mobile application allows users to choose what items they wish to donate by adding the corresponding details on the donation form while users can choose to receive food items by accepting donations and going to the location to pick up the item. TARGET USERS ============ Our primary users are users with smartphones who wish to donate and/or receive excess food. Teens (13 - 18) and Adults (18 - 65 years old) are the primary targets for this project. Users should be familiar with modern smartphones and social media applications as well as the methods to operate a camera.

We asked our interviewees a few questions to establish their demographics and details regarding their food wastage: - Who do you live with? - How much food would you say that your household usually throws away each week? - What are the main reasons that food gets wasted in your household? - What motivates you to avoid food waste? - How often do you donate food? Are there any particular food items that you ve donated/received more than others? - Are you ok with eating leftovers? If not, what might boost your confidence in eating them? - How far would you go/travel to pick up free food? - Have you ever volunteered with a shelter or organization? - Could you name a few shelters/NGOs in Chicago? We continued the conversations to get an idea of how aware people are about food wastage and other questions leaning towards user privacy and how ok they would be with sharing their location with unknown people while donating food. Surveys The goal of our survey was to gain an understanding of the most frequently performed actions when it comes to food wastage. We create a Google form with 10 questions which we shared with our classmates, friends, and family.

The goal of our project is to develop an application that not only raises awareness about food wastage but also facilitates the sharing of food between users thereby cutting down on the potential wastage. This not only brings the community closer but also allows people to meaningfully contribute to NGOs and food-insecure people. EVALUATION METHOD USERS The study was conducted using \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d, \u201cThink Aloud\u201d methodologies, and paper prototypes on 3 users. All 3 users are from CS 522 FORMATIVE EVALUATION STEPS 1. Before the users were asked to perform the tasks, they were given a brief introduction of the system setup and interactions supported by our systems by a facilitator. 2. Users were asked to perform 3 tasks 3. One member of the team observed the users while performing tasks for observations. TASKS 1. TASK CARDS Task 1: Add a new listing for donation/food item You have a 20-pound unopened bag of Basmati rice that you won\u2019t be able to finish off. It expires in a month. Instead of throwing away the rice, you decide to put it up for donation so that you can give away the food without wasting it. You want to create a new listing for the rice and input the corresponding the details such as the quantity, description of the item and how long till the rice expires amongst others. These details should be visible so that anyone interested in receiving the item gets all the information. Task 2: Editing information for an added donation item You realize you\u2019ve made a mistake when you were entering the details for the rice. You\u2019ve entered the wrong quantity for the amount of rice. Your task is to edit the information in the newly added rice listing and rectify the error you\u2019ve made. The listing should then show the updated quantity of rice so that all users interested in receiving the item get up-to-date information. Task 3: Finding a specific food item You\u2019ve added cereal to your bowl before realizing that you\u2019re out of milk. Instead of going out to buy milk, you want to check and see if anyone in your community happens to be donating some milk. Your task is to search for milk in the application and accept the donation of someone living nearby and notify them once you\u2019ve received the item. 2. INTERNAL WALKTHROUGH Fig 1: Main screen interface Fig 2: New Donation Form Task 1: Add a new listing for donation/food item Inputs/Assumptions \u25cf User is on the main screen Steps \u25cf Click on the green \u2018plus\u2019 icon in the bottom right corner of the interface \u25cf On the new form screen, users can start adding details in no particular order \u25cf Input rice in name of food item and provide a short description of rice \u25cf Set quantity of rice to 20 and set unit to pounds \u25cf Set the expiry date of an item \u25cf Click \u2018Submit\u2019 Instructions for user Task Card 1 Will the users know what to do? Yes. The user realized they need to click on the \u2018plus\u2019 sign to add a new donation food item. The user understood that clicking on \u2018Submit\u2019 in the donation form menu submits the listing for rice. Will the users see how to do it? The user went through the first page easily. But got stuck on the second page. The Expiry input(\u2018list for\u2019) was not obvious at first glance. Will the user see that progress is being made toward the solution of the task? Yes, the user accesses the donation form upon clicking the \u2018plus\u2019 button. Data is being input in a form so users can see text fields being filled. Walkthrough Comments \u25cf The \u2018List for days\u2019 was unintuitive and unrecognizable. Users were unable to understand the meaning behind the term. Something along the lines of \u2018best before\u2019 or \u2018expiry\u2019 would be more consistent with the real world \u25cf The placement and size of \u2018Pickup Location\u2019 was not noticeable. Also changing it to \u2018Select pickup location\u2019 would allow users to get a better understanding of the action needed to be done Fig 3: Accessing Rice item from recent community donations list Fig 4: Rice donation view Fig 5: Editing quantity of rice in Donation form Fig 6: Accessing rice item from timeline Fig 7: Rice donation view Fig 8: Editing quantity of rice in Donation form Task 2: Editing information for an added donation item Inputs/Assumptions \u25cf User is on main screen Steps \u25cf Click on the \u2018timeline\u2019 icon \u25cf Scroll through timeline till rice item is found \u25cf Click on the rice listing \u25cf Click on the \u2018Edit\u2019 button in the rice information dialog box \u25cf Enter the correct information in the quantity of rice \u25cf Click on the \u2018Submit\u2019 button once done OR \u25cf Scroll through the recent items list to find the donated item \u25cf Click on the rice listing \u25cf Click on the \u2018Edit\u2019 button in the rice information dialog box \u25cf Enter the correct information in quantity \u25cf Click on the \u2018Submit\u2019 button once done Instructions for user Task Card 2 Will the users know what to do? The users easily figured out the second path to reach the status page but struggled to connect the dots between timeline & status. Will the users see how to do it? No, For the first path, the users were unable to figure out that clicking on the latest item(in green) would take them to the corresponding status page. Will the user see that progress is being made toward the solution of the task? For the overall task, there is no indicator of progress shown. But as screens are displayed to the user, they are able to recognize options and icons related to the task which allows them to proceed in the right direction. Walkthrough Comments \u25cf Timeline icon is not intuitive. Users were unable to connect icons to the concept of a timeline. A change in a more recognizable icon would be better \u25cf When editing the item information, the submit button should have been replaced with an update button \u25cf All users opted to access rice items through the recent community donations list \u25cf Misconception regarding community donations on the main screen as users were under the assumption that the main screen showed users' own donations. Placing text above listings to indicate community donations would be appropriate \u25cf Listings in the timeline doesn\u2019t give affordance of being clickable. Consider adding an arrow or button style layout to allow users to understand that listing is explorable Fig 9: Searching for milk in the search bar in the main interface Fig 10: Viewing milk item information Fig 11: Status page of milk item listing Task 3: Finding specific food item Inputs/Assumptions \u25cf User is on main screen Steps \u25cf Click on search bar \u25cf Enter \u2018milk\u2019 in search bar \u25cf Scroll through milk listings to find appropriate item \u25cf Click on milk listing \u25cf Views item information \u25cf Click \u2018Accept\u2019 button once done \u25cf View real-time information from the status page and can message donator \u25cf Click on \u2018Received\u2019 button once item successfully received Instructions for user Task Card 3 Will the users know what to do? Yes, The users easily found the search bar to filter food items. Will the users see how to do it? Yes, They were able to go through the first 2 screens but Struggled to make sense of the received button after accepting the food. (You click on the received button to notify the donor that you have picked up the food). Will the user see that progress is being made toward the solution of the task? Yes, the status of the donation item is displayed on the page (ongoing/received/canceled) Walkthrough Comments \u25cf Lack of safety when accepting donations. Suggestion to add confirmation box before proceeding \u25cf No cancel option in case user is unable to receive food item \u25cf Location details can be added in pickup section \u25cf Chat icon in the top right corner was not used by any users. All users opted to access the message icon in the bottom toolbar POTENTIAL CHANGES \u25cf Task 1 \u25cb We plan on changing the wording of \u2018Pickup Location\u2019 to \u2018Select pickup location\u2019 so users would have a better understanding of what is needed to be done. Increase the size of text and change placement to a better location \u25cf Task 2 \u25cb Change the timeline icon to something more recognizable \u25cb Add arrows to timeline listings in the timeline screen to indicate that option is explorable \u25cb Add \u201cRecent Community Donations\u201d text above item listings on the main page to indicate community donations. \u25cf Task 3 \u25cb Add location details to the acceptance screen \u25cb Add a cancel button to cancel requests \u25cb Add a confirmation dialog box to add safety INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS Aditya Ranganathan: Screens, Introduction, Internal Walkthrough Karthik Singh: Screens, Task Cards, Changes"})}}]),o}(i.Component),y=function(e){Object(c.a)(o,e);var t=Object(d.a)(o);function o(){return Object(r.a)(this,o),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(h.a)(o,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(g.jsx)("div",{children:Object(g.jsx)("h2",{children:" Final"})})}}]),o}(i.Component),v=function(e){Object(c.a)(o,e);var t=Object(d.a)(o);function o(){return Object(r.a)(this,o),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(h.a)(o,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(g.jsx)("div",{children:"Design Challenge 1: Adding new food donations and specifying details Design Challenge 2: Tracking food donated and received In iteration 1, our initial designs showed a calendar-style summary interface that would make it highly learnable for novice users but poor in efficiency for expert users as they would be unable to keep track of their trends and progress. The Dashboard style interface with recent events improves efficiency by a wide margin but makes it difficult for users to get summary statistics regarding their donation/reception of food at a single glance. Taking elements from iteration 1, in iteration 2 we focus on trying to find a balance between showing enough information to maintain high efficiency while at the same keeping learnability and readability at an appropriate level so that users can easily understand the data. In iteration 2, we experiment with different designs such as the TImeline which shows the entire list of donated and received items on a date-wise basis. This is poor in efficiency as users will have to scroll to access each item and there\u2019s no summarized data being presented to the users. We then try implementing a simple minimalist interface that shows just summary statistics of each reception/donation. While high in learnability and readability, it doesn\u2019t allow expert users to keep track of their trends and understand whether by how large a margin their contributions. We further designed a more balanced interface that implements both the graph and donation statistics which can be interchanged by clicking on the arrow keys. Taking the best elements from iteration 2, we design the final interface where we implement a graph to show users their trends and compare the donation and reception trends. The graph is large, easily noticeable, and promotes readability. At the bottom of the screen, we implement summary statistics in a split window to promote readability, increase the efficiency of data being processed and take it one step further by adding a timeline window as well to allow users to gain granular control over the data they\u2019re being shown. Design Challenge 4: Communication between Donor and Receiver DESIGN REFLECTIONS Aditya\u2019s Design Reflection In terms of general interaction design, our group has focused more on improving the learnability of the application compared to efficiency and safety. Our original ideas were more geared towards efficiency and safety, rather than learnability. But, from the interviews and surveys conducted, we realized that there\u2019s a general lack of awareness when it comes to food donation. We wanted the application to be extremely user-friendly with a focus on high learnability so that users can quickly understand how the interface works and can start donating food. We hope to foster and increase both user and public awareness regarding food wastage. With that in mind, we\u2019ve selected simple and easily recognizable icons such as the \u2018Home\u2019 icon for the main page, the \u2018Magnifying Glass\u2019 which is a metaphor for searching, the \u2018Speech Bubble\u2019 icon which is a metaphor for communication and the \u2018Account\u2019 symbol, through rigorous use is easily recognizable now. Due to the large scope of the target audience, we tried to ensure that whatever icons and metaphors we used in the interface would be easily recognizable. During our group discussions, we kept referring to Nielsen\u2019s 10 principles to refine our design. We focused particularly on matching the user\u2019s mental model and systems model to improve learnability and readability. Another aspect that we were concerned about was user control. A few of the interviewees expressed their concerns about sharing their location with strangers. Taking these into consideration we wanted our users to have complete control over their data. Users can choose to either share their information or designate drop-off locations from where the food item can be collected. Finally, I can say that iterating through designs really helps to find potential and/or obscure issues. By coming up with various alternative designs, not only are we discovering new issues in designs that we otherwise thought were bulletproof, but also methods and components that can improve aspects of our design and improve usability principles. We can also mix-match components from multiple designs to create new interfaces which can reduce deficiencies that were originally present. APPENDIX Aditya\u2019s Individual Designs Adding new food donations and corresponding information Design Challenge: Keeping track of food donated/received Design Challenge: Communication between Donor and Receiver Design Challenge: Searching for donors/shelters/NGO\u2019s in the vicinity Karthik\u2019s Individual Designs Design Challenge: Searching for donors/shelters/NGO\u2019s in the vicinity In task 1 - (point 1,2,3 are iterations, point 4,5 are alternatives) you can see that in the first iteration(1) we started off with a listview having most of the interactive components including the search bar on the bottom of the screen so that it's easier for one handed thumb usage but in iteration(3) which is a combination of interaction 1 & 2 we moved it up to the top as we needed to dynamically display the list as the user starts giving input so that we could increase efficiency. Design Challenge: Adding new food donations and corresponding information. In task 2 - (point 1,2,3 are iterations, point 4 is an alternative) Iteration one was our very first design where we had assumed that only 1 photo was sufficient and current location would always be the pick up point for the receiver. In iteration 2 we added multiple image support as well as the ability to choose the location. To further improve on efficiency we added a mini map directly in iteration 3 so that the default location was more readable for the user,editable while expanded. point 4 is a non-photo alternative that we thought of for that some standard food outlets could use something like a big mac did not necessarily need a photo but the idea was discarded as there was minimal matching in the requirement. Design Challenge: Keeping track of food donated/received. In task 3 - (point 1,2,5 are iterations, point 3,4 are alternatives) we Initially thought of using the list view again where the list was separated by receiver, donor tabs but at a glance the user was not getting too much information in this layout so we thought of adding a graph in iteration 2 to make all the stats more readable at a glance, the graph would show count of items donated in a time range still separated by a tab. Then in the next iteration(5) we removed the tabs so that we could color code the graph that split donations/receptions along with the stats below to increase efficiency only to come to a point where we realized that it would be incredibly difficult to generate mean data for food measured with different standards. So we chose to discard 1,2,5 and built a timeline view(point 4) similar to phone logs showing donation/reception history in a vertical timeline. Design Challenge: Communication between Donor and Receiver In task 4(all points are alternatives). The basic idea always remained the same, having sender message to the left, receiver message to the right. Any other layout I could think of like grid view/ exploded view decreased readability by increasing clutter. So the final design layout looks similar to whatsapp/wechat/fb messenger. There were very few layouts I could think of that could outperform the above in any factor. Design Reflection In design 1 we first tried to focus more on efficiency only to realize that changing one component might affect another like increasing too much efficiency and making everything on the smartphone reachable by the thumb might decrease learnability & readability due to cluttering. So sometimes we need to balance between different factors. We get only a limited number of points which we could allocate as per our apps needs. In design 2 also as per the feedback from interviewees they wanted to know a lot more details about the food then we had previously thought. A simple food name might not suffice to give an incentive to most of our users to use the app & reduce wastage. To make it more trustworthy we had to add in more food detail inputs, multiple photos of food etc In design 3 We initially wanted to show overall statistics that would sum up the entire history, but as we went on through the iterations we realized that it is difficult to sum up the food donation details as standards for measuring food are dependent on the food itself. Some of the food items were measured in oz,gal,kg,count etc. so the final design we settled for (iteration no. 4) with the timeline view was a massive detour compared to the evolution from iteration 1,2 & 3. In design 4 was probably the easiest and straightforward, there is very little scope for improvement when it comes to messaging and that's the reason why most messaging applications use the left(sender) - right(receiver) view to communicate. In our group discussions we tried to take the best from both our individual iterative designs for each challenge in our final design. Sometimes we took all of one individual contribution and discarded the other and sometimes we tried to mix the best features. In conclusion, iterating the design & looking into the survey/interview feedback really helps to find potential and ambiguous problems. Methods and components that can improve design aspects and improve usability principles, as well as discover new design issues that were otherwise considered completely safe by developing a variety of alternative designs. Also discover. You can also combine components from multiple designs to create new interfaces that can reduce the defects that originally existed."})}}]),o}(i.Component),k=function(e){Object(c.a)(o,e);var t=Object(d.a)(o);function o(){return Object(r.a)(this,o),t.apply(this,arguments)}return Object(h.a)(o,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(g.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(g.jsx)("h2",{children:" concept "}),Object(g.jsx)("div",{children:"Conceptualization and Market Research ============================= CONCEPTUAL DIAGRAM PHOTO USER GOALS \u25cf To prevent wastage of food and keep track of savings \u25cf To know about local donors and shelters in the vicinity \u25cf To see the route from receiver to the donor \u25cf To get information regarding food being donated LITERATURE REVIEW AND MARKET ANALYSIS \u25cf 16 apps helping companies and consumers prevent food waste - Katerina Bozhinova \u25cb Multiple applications are leveraging the concept of sharing food to reduce wastage.
